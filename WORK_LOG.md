| Sept 11 | 12:50-1:45 | Thought through different ways of solving. I orginally thought that BFS would be the most efficient, but I don't think that is actually the best way to do it. I want to figure out how to separate each individual ecosystem as my first step. I tried to implement a system where I THOUGHT I was going through every possible cost but I quickly realized that was wrong. Onto the next option! |

While this seems shocking, the hospital cost * n could actually exceed the integer max value, so I tried making it a long. This fixed the problem, and now my test case works! |
