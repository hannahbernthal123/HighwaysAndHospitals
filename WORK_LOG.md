| Sept 11 | 12:50-1:45 |                                                                                                         Thought through different ways of solving. I orginally thought that BFS would be the most efficient, but I don't think that is actually the best way to do it. I want to figure out how to separate each individual ecosystem as my first step. I tried to implement a system where I THOUGHT I was going through every possible cost but I quickly realized that was wrong. Onto the next option! |
| Sept 12 |   9-9:15   |                                                                                                                                                                                         My edge case of when the hospitals cost less than the highways wasn't working, so I did some research as to what might be going on. While this seems shocking, the hospital cost * n could actually exceed the integer max value, so I tried making it a long. This fixed the problem, and now my test case works! |
| Sept 14 |    9-11    | I was on a plane, so I can't say this was peak productivity, but I really spent some time mapping out different options and trying to get to the root of the problem. I am starting to piece together how to separate each ecosystem because once I finish that, I think I could do a simple BFS within the ecosystem itself. I also played around with the idea of having an array that represents possible options like what was in my code before. I am excited to hear some about the theory in class. |
| Sept 15 | 7:30-8:15  |                                                                                                  I am thinking through the process of perhaps a for loop to go through and trace the roots. Right now I am thinking a nested-for loop is the best route, but I want to keep playing around with it. Some other ideas I am playing with are the cases when you don't need to change the root because it would create a cycle. I believe an if statement would be the best approach to this as of right now. |
| Sept 16 |   6-6:30   |                                                            Worked through the approach of making a recursive function to find the root of each node passed in. I think it would work if you have the base case check if it currently is its own root (i.e. the root is 0), and if it is, you simply return itself. Then the recursive call would be when the node's root ISN'T itself, and in that case it would run it again passing in the node's root until you eventually get to the top of the chain. |
| Sept 16 |   6:30-7   |                            I am still unsure about how I am going to implement sorting out the root of each node. I understand how to find the root, but I am still grappling with filling in the array if that makes sense. I am excited to keep working on it in class. I also wanted to start implementing a loop that will count the individual ecosystems once I have filled in the array. I believe a simple for loop where I iterate through and count how many indexes have values of 0 is plenty. |
