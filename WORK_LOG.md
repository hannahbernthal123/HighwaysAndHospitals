| Sept 11 | 12:50-1:45 |                                                                                                          Thought through different ways of solving. I orginally thought that BFS would be the most efficient, but I don't think that is actually the best way to do it. I want to figure out how to separate each individual ecosystem as my first step. I tried to implement a system where I THOUGHT I was going through every possible cost but I quickly realized that was wrong. Onto the next option! |
| Sept 12 |   9-9:15   |                                                                                                                                                                                          My edge case of when the hospitals cost less than the highways wasn't working, so I did some research as to what might be going on. While this seems shocking, the hospital cost * n could actually exceed the integer max value, so I tried making it a long. This fixed the problem, and now my test case works! |
| Sept 14 |    9-11    |  I was on a plane, so I can't say this was peak productivity, but I really spent some time mapping out different options and trying to get to the root of the problem. I am starting to piece together how to separate each ecosystem because once I finish that, I think I could do a simple BFS within the ecosystem itself. I also played around with the idea of having an array that represents possible options like what was in my code before. I am excited to hear some about the theory in class. |
